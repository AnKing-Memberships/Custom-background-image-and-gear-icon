`You can add custom images to the folders "background" and "gears" These are located within the "user_files" folder in the add-on folder. You see this folder if you click the button "View Files" on the right of the add-on manager window when you have selected this add-on. I would recommend using 20-50% opacity images for the background`

* **Image name for background:** _(For no image use "")_ name of the background image file. (preloaded images include Christ&Surgeon.png, AnKing.png)
* **Image name for gear:** _(Anki default is "gears.svg")_ name of the file to replace the gear icon. (preloaded images include AnKing.png, flame.svg)

`The following are css values and can be styled with appropriate css values for these css properties. See w3schools.com for more information.`

* **background-attachment:** _(default "fixed")_ 
* **background-position:** _(default "center")_
* **background-repeat:** _(default "no-repeat")_
